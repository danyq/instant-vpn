These are some scripts for quickly configuring a server as a VPN. This is NOT a complete or secure configuration.

The scripts are very brittle and are only meant to be run once on a brand new Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server, with nothing else configured. For any other situation, just consider this a convenient collection of commands to reference.
